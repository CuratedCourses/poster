\begin{sectionblock}{Focus}
  The project focuses on \textbf{linear algebra} as a course which can
  be taught from a variety of perspectives.  Some students seek
  real-world applications, and others want to see the theory developed
  in an abstract setting.

  The project team developed a platform for disseminating and hosting 
  open mathematics content.

  \vspace{1ex}A resource submitted to the platform enters a moderation queue,
  permitting curation by experts, and is tagged with
  \textbf{standardized topics} and \textbf{learning outcomes},
  permitting alignment high-quality resources to textbooks.
